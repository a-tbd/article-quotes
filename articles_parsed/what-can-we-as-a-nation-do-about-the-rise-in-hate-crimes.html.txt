Have you seen an increase in hate speech where you live? Have you noticed any increase in bullying, threats or other hateful actions? What can we, as individuals and as a nation, do about hate crimes directed at people because of their ethnicity, gender, race or religion?
In “Attacks on Muslim Americans Fuel Increase in Hate Crime, F.B.I. Says,” Eric Lichtblau writes:
Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:
— Have you noticed any increase in bullying, threats or other hateful actions where you live?
— What positive things have you, your family, your school or your community done to make your world a more kind, supportive and safe place for all people? Do these things take time? Money? Courage? Organization or advance planning? Explain.
— What suggestions do you have for our nation as a whole? For adults? For our government leaders?
— The Times reports that “as a show of support, groups of people across America are attaching safety pins to their lapels, shirts and dresses to signify that they are linked, willing to stand up for the vulnerable.” What do you think about symbolic acts like this? Do you think they can make a positive difference?
