  Mr. Sessions, a deeply conservative Republican from Alabama who was an early Trump supporter, appears headed for confirmation after completing more than nine hours of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr. Sessions and his allies had girded for a coordinated attack on his civil rights record, but Democrats tempered their criticism and Republicans mounted a pre-emptive defense, describing him repeatedly as a man of integrity.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="361" data-total-count="1102">
  In his two decades on Capitol Hill, Mr. Sessions has questioned whether the Constitution guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the United States, has said courts have interpreted the separation of church and state too broadly and has declared

  Much of the hearing focused on Mr. Sessions’s long record as a prosecutor and a senator, but Mr. Trump proved a dominant figure in absentia for much of the debate as Democrats sought to question the president-elect by proxy. They asked whether Mr. Sessions supported Mr. Trump’s most controversial statements and questioned whether he had the independence to rein in the strong-willed Mr. Trump if he seeks to exceed his presidential authority.

  “If an attorney general is asked to do something that’s plainly unlawful,” he said, “that person would have to resign ultimately before agreeing to execute a policy that the attorney general believes would be unlawful or unconstitutional.”

  “I don’t think it would be hard for me to be impartial and enforce laws that I didn’t vote for,” he said. “I think I can separate my personal votes of maybe years ago from what my responsibilities is today.”

  by intelligence agencies that Russia tried to influence the American election, he said that “I have no reason to doubt that and no information that would indicate otherwise” — a sharp contrast from Mr. Trump’s weeks of skepticism. Mr. Trump last week called the uproar over Russia’s role a “political witch hunt.”
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="180" data-total-count="3747">
  He said he also opposed creating a registry of American Muslims or banning Muslim immigrants, as Mr. Trump proposed repeatedly during the campaign in response to terrorist attacks.

 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="318" data-total-count="4065">
  “I have no belief and do not support the idea that Muslims as a religious group should be denied admission to the United States,” Mr. Sessions said. But he said he supported using “extreme vetting” of immigrants that might take into account religious beliefs — an idea Mr. Trump now appears to have endorsed.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="214" data-total-count="4279">
  Mr. Sessions also appeared to play down the prospects that his Justice Department would seek to jail Hillary Clinton over her private email server, another pledge that Mr. Trump made repeatedly during the campaign.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="248" data-total-count="4527">
  Mr. Sessions surprised lawmakers by declaring that he would recuse himself from any decisions on Mrs. Clinton’s emails or the Clinton Foundation because he said that critical statements he made about her during the campaign might pose a conflict.

  Mr. Sessions had previously supported appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs. Clinton. The F.B.I.’s investigation into her private email server is closed, and while a preliminary investigation into the Clinton Foundation is open, senior law enforcement officials say there is little basis for the case to move forward.

  He deflected questions about Mr. Trump with a calm stoicism, but he grew angry and emotional when Democrats pressed him on a more personal matter:

 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="369" data-total-count="5528">
  Protesters in the ornate Senate hearing room, who disrupted the proceedings more than a dozen times during the day, erupted in chants of “Sessions is a racist!” and “No Trump, no K.K.K., no fascist U.S.A.!” Two men dressed as Klansmen in white robes and hoods shouted their mocking support for Mr. Sessions before security officers hustled them out of the room.

  With his voice rising, Mr. Sessions called accusations that he had made racist remarks in the 1980s “damnably false.” Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican friend who introduced Mr. Sessions for the hearing, came to his defense, pointing to Mr. Sessions’s prosecution of Klan members in an Alabama murder and his appointment of the first African-American chief counsel to the Judiciary Committee’s Republican staff.

 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="261" data-total-count="6514">
  While Mr. Sessions sought to distance himself on Tuesday from some of Mr. Trump’s controversial stances, he embraced the president-elect’s focus on toughened immigration laws and a “law and order” agenda — priorities he himself has stressed for years.
