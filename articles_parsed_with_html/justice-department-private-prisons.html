<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="311" data-total-count="789">In a memo released on Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions directed federal prison officials to keep using the private prisons. He also withdrew a policy set out last August by Sally Q. Yates, then the deputy attorney general, who had ordered prison officials to phase out the use of the private facilities.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="354" data-total-count="1143">Ms. Yates’s order had followed a report from the Justice Department inspector general about safety and security concerns with the operations at private prisons, along with other issues. The private prisons “compare poorly to our own bureau facilities” in a number of areas and do not save much money, Ms. Yates wrote as she ordered them phased out.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="1341">Mr. Sessions, in withdrawing her order, said the Yates directive had “changed longstanding policy and practice” and hurt the prison system’s ability “to meet the future needs” for housing.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="275" data-total-count="1616">President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/politics/trump-immigration-ban-memo.html" title="Times article.">fired Ms. Yates</a> as acting attorney general last month over an unrelated matter, when she refused to defend the ban he had ordered on travelers from seven largely Muslim countries. The courts have blocked the travel ban, and the administration is rewriting it.</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
