<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="317" data-total-count="317">WASHINGTON — A divided Senate Judiciary Committee approved the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general Wednesday, despite a fierce pushback from Democrats over President Trump’s firing this week of the Justice Department’s acting chief, who had objected to the administration’s refugee policy.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="463">The action came on a straight party-line vote, with 11 Republicans supporting their former colleague from Alabama and nine Democrats opposing him.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="260" data-total-count="723">The full, Republican-controlled Senate now appears ready to approve Mr. Sessions’ nomination next week, which would give the Justice Department and its 113,000 employees a full-time boss after a tumultuous few days that called its independence into question.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="325" data-total-count="1048">The judiciary committee vote came two days after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/politics/trump-immigration-ban-memo.html">Mr. Trump ousted Sally Q. Yates</a>, a holdover from the Obama administration who was acting attorney general. Ms Yates had refused to defend the president’s order on refugees, saying its legality was unclear. The White House accused her of having “betrayed” her department.</p><div class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent " id="story-ad-1">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="491" data-total-count="1539" id="story-continues-1">Democrats zeroed in Ms. Yates’s dismissal, and said Mr. Sessions, an early supporter of Mr. Trump’s long-shot campaign who went on to become an influential adviser, would not have the independence to challenge the White House on questions of the law and policy. At his confirmation hearing last month, Mr. Sessions pledged repeatedly that he would be able to “say no” to Mr. Trump if needed and would not be “a mere rubber stamp” on issues like immigration and national security.</p>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="350" data-total-count="1889" id="story-continues-3">The debate turned ugly as committee members traded personal barbs and accusations of “untoward” behavior.
