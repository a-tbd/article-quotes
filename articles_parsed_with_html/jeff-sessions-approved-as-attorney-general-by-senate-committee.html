  WASHINGTON — A divided Senate Judiciary Committee approved the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general Wednesday, despite a fierce pushback from Democrats over President Trump’s firing this week of the Justice Department’s acting chief, who had objected to the administration’s refugee policy.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="463">
  The action came on a straight party-line vote, with 11 Republicans supporting their former colleague from Alabama and nine Democrats opposing him.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="260" data-total-count="723">
  The full, Republican-controlled Senate now appears ready to approve Mr. Sessions’ nomination next week, which would give the Justice Department and its 113,000 employees a full-time boss after a tumultuous few days that called its independence into question.

  The judiciary committee vote came two days after

   Mr. Trump ousted Sally Q. Yates

  , a holdover from the Obama administration who was acting attorney general. Ms Yates had refused to defend the president’s order on refugees, saying its legality was unclear. The White House accused her of having “betrayed” her department.

  Democrats zeroed in Ms. Yates’s dismissal, and said Mr. Sessions, an early supporter of Mr. Trump’s long-shot campaign who went on to become an influential adviser, would not have the independence to challenge the White House on questions of the law and policy. At his confirmation hearing last month, Mr. Sessions pledged repeatedly that he would be able to “say no” to Mr. Trump if needed and would not be “a mere rubber stamp” on issues like immigration and national security.

  The debate turned ugly as committee members traded personal barbs and accusations of “untoward” behavior. The jousting started when Senator

   Al Franken
  </a>
  , a Minnesota Democrat, began challenging Mr. Sessions’s civil rights record and claimed that another committee member, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, had “misrepresented” the issue.

 <div id="#continues-post-newsletter">

 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="154" data-total-count="2043">
  Mr. Cruz was not at the committee hearing at the time, but his fellow Texan, Senator John Cornyn, rushed to his defense and cut off Mr. Franken midspeech.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="127" data-total-count="2170">
  “I object to the senator disparaging a fellow member of the committee here in his absence,” Mr. Cornyn interjected angrily.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="106" data-total-count="2276">
  “Well, he should be here — first of all — and, secondly, he disparaged me,” Mr. Franken responded.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="169" data-total-count="2445">
  “I would hope he would do it to his face,” Mr. Cornyn said. The attack on Mr. Cruz, he said a moment later, was “untoward and it’s inappropriate and I object.”
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="135" data-total-count="2580">
  Senator Charles E. Grassley, the chairman of the committee, told the two senators that “we’d be better off if we just let it go.”
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="127" data-total-count="2707">
  But the two senators did not, and Mr. Grassley eventually complained that they were putting him “in an awful bad position.”
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="66" data-total-count="2773">
  “Could you please leave personalities out of it?” he implored.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="81" data-total-count="2854">
  Mr. Franken went right on talking — with Mr. Cruz at the center of his attacks.
