  of Kentucky, the majority leader, signaled on Sunday that he was unwilling to reschedule any confirmation hearings, which are set to begin with sessions for John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump’s choice to be the secretary of Homeland Security, and for Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the nominee to be attorney general. Five more hearings are scheduled for Wednesday.

  The majority leader said that while the vetting process for some nominees might not be completed in time for their hearings, he was optimistic it would be finished before the Senate votes on each of the nominees.

  Several of Mr. Trump’s nominees are likely to face sharp questioning from Democrats about their records. But, when asked by reporters on Sunday whether he thought all of Mr. Trump’s appointees would be confirmed, Sean Spicer, who will be the White House press secretary, said, “Yes, we have an unbelievable all-star group of nominees.”

  Among those who will likely face tough scrutiny are Mr. Sessions and Rex W. Tillerson, the nominee to become secretary of state, whose hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="420" data-total-count="2578">
  Mr. Sessions will no doubt have to answer questions that have dogged him for 30 years about his racial attitudes while serving as a federal prosecutor in Alabama. Mr. Tillerson, a former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, will face concerns about his company’s deep economic ties to Russia — particularly in light of the intelligence report released last week concluding that Moscow sought to interfere in the election.

 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="344" data-total-count="2922">
  The Trump transition team, seeking to create an air of invincibility before the hearings, said in a statement on Sunday that the nominees have spent some 70 hours participating in “mock” hearings, have answered more than 2,600 questions from aides and volunteers posing as senators, and have met with 87 senators — including 37 Democrats.
