Thompson, a friend of Mr. Sessions’s who worked with him in the 1980s when both were federal prosecutors, said the senator had “a commitment to both strong law enforcement and equal justice for all.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="393" data-total-count="1816">The day’s testimony highlighted the strong racial undertones of Mr. Sessions’s nomination. Three decades ago, the Senate rejected Mr. Sessions for a federal judgeship over questions about his failed prosecution of African-Americans in a fraud case and racially insensitive comments he was reported to have made. He acknowledged using words like “un-American” to describe the N.A.A.C.P.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="218" data-total-count="2034">Black leaders say that those accusations still resonate with them and that his votes as a senator in more recent years in opposition to a number of civil rights bills have given them more reason to question his record.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="333" data-total-count="2367">About a dozen members of the Congressional Black Caucus, along with civil rights leaders, turned out at Wednesday’s hearing in support of Mr. Lewis and two other black Democrats — Senator <a class="meta-per" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/cory_booker/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Cory Booker.">Cory Booker</a> of New Jersey and Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana — as they voiced their opposition to Mr. Sessions’s nomination.</p><div aria-labeledby="newsletter-promo-heading" class="newsletter-signup hidden auto-newsletter variant-1-hidden " data-newsletter-productcode="" data-newsletter-producttitle="" id="newsletter-promo">
