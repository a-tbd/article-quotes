Have you noticed any increase in bullying, threats or other hateful actions? What can we, as individuals and as a nation, do about hate crimes directed at people because of their ethnicity, gender, race or religion?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="101" data-total-count="373">In “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/us/politics/fbi-hate-crimes-muslims.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0">Attacks on Muslim Americans Fuel Increase in Hate Crime, F.B.I. Says</a>,” Eric Lichtblau writes:</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="1269" data-total-count="1642"><p>The F.B.I. reported Monday that attacks against American Muslims surged last year, driving an overall increase in hate crime against all groups.</p>
<p>The data, which is the most comprehensive look at hate crime nationwide, expanded on previous findings by researchers and outside monitors, who have noted an alarming rise in some types of crimes tied to the vitriol of this year’s presidential campaign and the aftermath of terrorist attacks at home and abroad since 2015.</p>
<p>That trend appears to have spiked in just the last week, with civil rights groups and news organizations reporting dozens of verbal or physical assaults on minorities and others that appear to have been fueled by divisions over the election.</p>
<p>In its report on Monday, the F.B.I. cataloged a total of 5,818 hate crimes in 2015 — a rise of about 6 percent over the previous year — including assaults, bombings, threats, and property destruction against minorities, women, gays and others.</p>
<p>Attacks against Muslim Americans saw the biggest surge. There were 257 reports of assaults, attacks on mosques and other hate crimes against Muslims last year, a jump of about 67 percent over 2014. It was the highest total since 2001, when more than 480 attacks occurred in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="48" data-total-count="1690"><strong>Students:</strong> Read the entire article, then tell us:</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="95" data-total-count="1785">— Have you noticed any increase in bullying, threats or other hateful actions where you live?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="242" data-total-count="2027">— What positive things have you, your family, your school or your community done to make your world a more kind, supportive and safe place for all people?
