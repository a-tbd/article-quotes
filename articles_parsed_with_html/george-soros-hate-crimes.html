The F.B.I. reported last week that there was an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/us/politics/fbi-hate-crimes-muslims.html">increase of nearly 67 percent</a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/us/politics/fbi-hate-crimes-muslims.html"> last year</a> in hate crimes against Muslim Americans — and an increase of 6 percent against all groups.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="476" data-total-count="2795">Between the election and Friday, the Southern Poverty Law Center received more than 700 reports of harassment and possible hate crimes, it said — with the majority coming in the days immediately after the Nov. 8 election. Immigrants were the most frequent targets, the center said, but blacks, gays, Muslims and other minorities also reported being victimized in schools, streets and houses of worship. The episodes have included both verbal harassment and physical attacks.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="96" data-total-count="2891">The group said it had also received 27 complaints of episodes targeting supporters of Mr. Trump.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="194" data-total-count="3085">This week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, Democrat of New York, announced the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/nyregion/rally-in-brooklyn-park-condemns-swastikas-and-go-trump-graffiti.html">creation of a new state police unit</a> and other steps to combat what he called the “explosion of hate crimes in our state.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="363" data-total-count="3448">In an interview with CBS News’s “60 Minutes” that aired days after the election, Mr. Trump was asked about reports that some of his supporters had harassed or attacked minorities after his victory. “I am so saddened to hear that,” he said. “And I say, ‘Stop it.’ If it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: ‘Stop it.’”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="209" data-total-count="3657">He has also faced criticism over the political support he has received from so-called alt-right groups, including <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/us/politics/alt-right-trump.html">white supremacists who gave “Hail victory” salutes</a> at a Washington convention last weekend.</p><div class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent " id="story-ad-2">

        Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated when “60 Minutes” aired an interview with President-elect Donald J. Trump. It was Nov. 13, not Nov. 20.    </div>
