<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="297" data-total-count="297">WASHINGTON — American spy and law enforcement agencies were united in the belief, in the weeks before the presidential election, that the Russian government had deployed computer hackers to sow chaos during the campaign. But they had conflicting views about the specific goals of the subterfuge.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="220" data-total-count="517">Last week, Central Intelligence Agency officials presented lawmakers with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/us/obama-russia-election-hack.html" title="Times article.">a stunning new judgment</a> that upended the debate: Russia, they said, had intervened with the primary aim of helping make Donald J. Trump president.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="457" data-total-count="974">The C.I.A.’s conclusion does not appear to be the product of specific new intelligence obtained since the election, several American officials, including some who had read the agency’s briefing, said on Sunday. Rather, it was an analysis of what many believe is overwhelming circumstantial evidence — evidence that others feel does not support firm judgments — that the Russians put a thumb on the scale for Mr. Trump, and got their desired outcome.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="405" data-total-count="1379">It is unclear why the C.I.A. did not produce this formal assessment before the election, although several officials said that parts of it had been made available to President Obama in the presidential daily briefing in the weeks before the vote. But the conclusion that Moscow ran an operation to help install the next president is one of the most consequential analyses by American spy agencies in years.</p><div class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent " id="story-ad-1">

I don’t believe it,” Mr. Trump said on Sunday in an interview on Fox News. Some top Republican congressmen have said the same, although with less bombastic language, arguing that there is no clear proof that the Russians tried to rig the election for Mr. Trump.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="164" data-total-count="2138">Yet there is a loud chorus of bipartisan voices, including Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, going public to accuse the Russians of election interference.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="242" data-total-count="2380">Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the public evidence alone made it clear that Moscow had intervened to help the “most ostentatiously pro-Russian candidate in history.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="150" data-total-count="2530">“If the Russians were going to interfere, why on earth would they do it to the detriment of the candidate that was pro-Russian?” Mr. Schiff asked.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="248" data-total-count="2778">The dispute cuts to core realities of intelligence analysis.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="176" data-total-count="2954">“This is why I hate the term ‘we speak truth to power,’” said Mark M.

We have really good ideas.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="353" data-total-count="3307">Mr. Lowenthal said that determining the motives of foreign leaders — in this case, what drove President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to order the hacking — was one of the most important missions for C.I.A. analysts. In 2002, one of the critical failures of American spy agencies was their inability to understand Saddam Hussein’s goals and motives.</p><div class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent " id="story-ad-2">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="3453" id="story-continues-4">At the same time, Mr. Lowenthal said, intelligence agencies have always been loath to be seen as taking sides in disputes about American politics.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="130" data-total-count="3583">“This is the one place you don’t want to be as an intelligence officer: the meat in someone’s partisan sandwich,” he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="226" data-total-count="3809">Both intelligence and law enforcement officials agree that there is a mountain of circumstantial evidence suggesting that the Russian hacking was primarily aimed at helping Mr. Trump and damaging his opponent, Hillary Clinton.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="601" data-total-count="4410">In July, the infiltration of the Democratic National Committee’s computer servers produced <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/23/us/politics/dnc-emails-sanders-clinton.html" title="Times article.">embarrassing emails</a> and other internal party documents, the publication of which caused a backlash that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/25/us/politics/debbie-wasserman-schultz-dnc-wikileaks-emails.html" title="Times article.">led to the resignation</a> of the committee’s chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and her top staff. Just weeks before the election, hacked emails from the account of John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s top campaign manager, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/us/private-security-group-says-russia-was-behind-john-podestas-email-hack.html" title="Times article.">were made public</a> and produced numerous stories about the internal dynamics of the campaign. That hack also produced <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/politics/hillary-clinton-speeches-wikileaks.html" title="Times article.">the text of speeches</a> Mrs. Clinton had given to Wall Street banks.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="220" data-total-count="4630">American intelligence officials believe that Russia also penetrated databases housing Republican National Committee data, but chose to release documents only on the Democrats. The committee has denied that it was hacked.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="159" data-total-count="4789">Beyond the specific targets of the hacks, American officials cite broad evidence that Mr. Putin and the Russian government favored Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="300" data-total-count="5089">After demonstrators marched through Moscow in 2011 chanting “Putin is a thief” and “Russia without Putin,” Mr. Putin <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/world/europe/putin-accuses-clinton-of-instigating-russian-protests.html" title="Times article.">publicly accused</a> Mrs. Clinton, then the secretary of state, of instigating the protests. “She set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal,” he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="436" data-total-count="5525">More generally, the Russian government has blamed Mrs. Clinton, along with the C.I.A. and other American officials, for encouraging anti-Russian revolts during the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia and the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine. What Americans saw as legitimate democracy promotion, Mr. Putin saw as an unwarranted intrusion into Russia’s geographic sphere of interest, as the United States once saw Soviet meddling in Cuba.</p><div class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent " id="story-ad-3">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="197" data-total-count="6256">Russian television, which is tightly controlled by the government, has generally <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/05/russian-media-backs-trump-questions-us-democracy.html" title="CNBC article.">portrayed</a> Mr. Trump as a strong, friendly potential partner while often airing scathing assessments of Mrs. Clinton.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="199" data-total-count="6455">And yet, there is skepticism within the American government, particularly at the F.B.I., that this evidence adds up to proof that the Russians had the specific objective of getting Mr. Trump elected.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="296" data-total-count="6751">A senior American law enforcement official said the F.B.I. believed that the Russians probably had a combination of goals, including damaging Mrs. Clinton and undermining American democratic institutions. Whether one of those goals was to install Mr. Trump remains unclear to the F.B.I., he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="196" data-total-count="6947">The official played down any disagreement between the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., and suggested that the C.I.A.’s conclusions were probably more nuanced than they were being framed in the news media.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="400" data-total-count="7347">The agencies’ differences in judgment may also reflect different methods of investigating the Russian interference. The F.B.I., which has both a law enforcement and an intelligence role, is held to higher standards of proof in examining people involved in the hacking because it has an eye toward eventual criminal prosecutions. The C.I.A. has a broader mandate to develop intelligence assessments.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="326" data-total-count="7673">Law enforcement officials said that if F.B.I. agents had the evidence to charge Russians with specific crimes, they would do so. The F.B.I. and federal prosecutors have already gone aggressively after Russian hackers, including two men detained in Thailand and the Czech Republic whom the United States is trying to extradite.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="100" data-total-count="7773">Russia has tried to block those efforts and has accused the United States of harassing its citizens.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="428" data-total-count="8201">The F.B.I. began investigating Russia’s apparent attempts to meddle in the election over the summer. Agents examined numerous possible connections between Russians and members of Mr. Trump’s inner circle, including former Trump aides like Paul Manafort and Carter Page, as well as a mysterious and unexplained trail of computer activity between the Trump Organization and an email account at a large Russian bank, Alfa Bank.</p><div class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent " id="story-ad-4">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="303" data-total-count="8504" id="story-continues-6">At the height of its investigation before the election, the F.B.I. saw some indications that the Russians might be explicitly seeking to get Mr. Trump elected, officials said, and investigators collected online evidence and conducted interviews overseas and inside the United States to test that theory.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="433" data-total-count="8937">The F.B.I. was concerned enough about Russia’s influence and possible connections to the Trump campaign that it briefed congressional leaders — including Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and Senate minority leader — on some of the evidence this summer and fall. Mr. Reid, in particular, pressed for the F.B.I. to find out more and charged that the agency was sitting on important information that could implicate Russia.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="291" data-total-count="9228">But the agency’s suspicions about a direct effort by Russia to help Mr. Trump, or about possible connections between the two camps, appear to have waned as the investigation continued into September and October. The reasons are not entirely clear, and F.B.I. officials declined to comment.</p><button class="button comments-button theme-speech-bubble-large" data-skip-to-para-id="">
