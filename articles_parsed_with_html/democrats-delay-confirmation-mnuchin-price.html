  WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats significantly escalated tensions with the White House on Tuesday, stalling action on two of President Trump’s most important cabinet nominees, Steven T. Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary and Representative Tom Price to be secretary of health and human services.

  Democrats boycotted a meeting of the Senate Finance Committee that had been scheduled to vote on the two nominees. They said they had been misled by the nominees and wanted an opportunity to investigate unanswered questions about Mr. Price’s investments and Mr. Mnuchin’s role in a bank that has been criticized for aggressive

  The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said Democrats were “manufacturing issues on a daily basis” to string out the confirmation process and to hobble Mr. Trump.

  “I asked Congressman Price directly if he got an exclusive discount, and he said no,” said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee. “The evidence tells a different story,” Mr. Wyden added. “It looks more and more like Congressman Price got special access to a special deal.”

  At the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Democrats cited Mr. Trump’s firing of the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, as a reason to block Mr. Sessions’s nomination. They said he was too close to Mr. Trump to be independent.

 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="191" data-total-count="5425">
  Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said Ms. Yates had shown “guts” in refusing to defend Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration.
