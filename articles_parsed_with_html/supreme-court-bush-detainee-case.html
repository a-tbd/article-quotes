  WASHINGTON — The federal government’s frantic response to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, sparked renewed debate Wednesday at the Supreme Court, as justices considered whether top officials in the George W. Bush administration could be held responsible for abuses against Muslim immigrants and others rounded up after the attacks.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="211" data-total-count="544">
  Conservatives on the court, citing the extraordinary peril of that time, appeared willing to give the officials legal protection from lawsuits arising from the detention policies they approved after the attacks.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="66" data-total-count="610">
  But some of the more liberal justices did not appear so forgiving.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="186" data-total-count="796">
  Even in a time of national emergency, government officials sometimes “can go too far,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer said. “And if they have gone too far, it is our job to say that.”
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="221" data-total-count="1017">
  The case centers on the government’s roundup and mistreatment of 762 men who were in the United States illegally — mainly Muslims from Arab and South Asian nations — in the days and weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks.

  Not one of the men was found to have had any connection to the attacks or to terrorism, yet some were held in detention centers in Brooklyn and New Jersey for as long as eight months under harsh conditions and with sporadic access to family or lawyers.

  Many prisoners were kept in tiny cells in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, deprived of sleep, given “meager and barely edible” food and strip-searched regularly. Investigators
  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/02/politics/us-report-faults-the-roundup-of-illegal-immigrants-after-911.html">
   later determined
  </a>
  that guards in Brooklyn, in particular, beat prisoners and threw them against walls, taunting them as “terrorists.”
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="342" data-total-count="1935">
  Eight of the former prisoners are seeking to personally sue former Bush administration officials — including John D. Ashcroft, who was the attorney general, and

  , who was F.B.I. director — for creating the policies they claim led to the abuse. Six of the former detainees are Muslim, one is Hindu and one is Buddhist.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="331" data-total-count="2266">
  In seeking to head off the prospect of additional, “follow on” attacks, Mr. Ashcroft and the Justice Department approved a “hold until cleared” policy for the prisoners. That meant the F.B.I. had to affirmatively declare a prisoner was not a terrorist threat before he was released to face standard immigration proceedings.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="426" data-total-count="2692">
  The policy was divisive even within the government. One of the officials being sued in the case — James W. Ziglar, who was the immigration commissioner at the time and objected to some of the Justice Department’s detention policies as improper — has his own lawyer in the case because of the clashing interests. “We didn’t want Jim lumped in with others,” his lawyer, William A. McDaniel Jr., said in an interview.

 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="311" data-total-count="3003">
  Rachel Meeropol, a lawyer with the
  <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">
   Center for Constitutional Rights
  </a>
  who represented the former detainees, told the court that if the government succeeds in the case, “any Muslim or Arab noncitizen present in this country could be placed for months in solitary confinement for violating the immigration law.”
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="245" data-total-count="3248">
  The Supreme Court, she said, “has a historic role to play in ensuring that race and religion do not take the place of legitimate grounds for suspicion and in deterring future federal officials from creating government policy to do the same.”
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="182" data-total-count="3430">
  But Ian H. Gershengorn, the acting solicitor general, said it would be a troubling expansion of the law for top government officials to be held personally liable in such a situation.
 </p>
 <div class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent " id="story-ad-2">
 </div>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="380" data-total-count="3810" id="story-continues-4">
  As the officials set policies in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, “you couldn’t tell who was and who was not” a possible terrorist, Mr. Gershengorn said. In that situation, he said, the decision to hold everyone until they were cleared was driven “not by invidious intent, but by the desire to avoid the premature and inadvertent release of a dangerous terrorist.”
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="262" data-total-count="4072">
  Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. appeared sympathetic to that view. He told Ms. Meeropol that he was concerned that expanding the law to hold government officials personally liable for their actions in such cases could deter people from entering the government.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="120" data-total-count="4192">
  “They’re going to say, ‘Well, gosh, if, you know, I’m wrong, I’m going to be sued,’” Justice Roberts said.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="160" data-total-count="4352">
  “We don’t want people forming policy to have to worry” that they will be required to pay personal damages if that policy is found to be in error, he said.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="245" data-total-count="4597">
  Justice Breyer said that in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, “I can understand that the first reaction of the law enforcement authorities is, pick up anybody you might think is connected, and we’ll worry about the rest of it later.”
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="142" data-total-count="4739">
  But he and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said they were troubled that many of the prisoners were kept in jail for many months after the attacks.
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="312" data-total-count="5051">
  “You know from Day 1,” Justice Ginsburg told Mr. Gershengorn, “that many of them have nothing to do with terrorists, and yet you allow that system that might have been justified in October to persist for months and months when these people are being held in the worst possible conditions of confinement.”
 </p>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="460" data-total-count="5511">
  Justices Ginsburg and Breyer may be outnumbered in the final vote, however. Two of their liberal colleagues on the court — Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — have recused themselves from the case because of apparent conflicts involving their posts before joining the court, and that has helped the government’s chances of winning. Justice Sotomayor was formerly a judge on the Second Circuit, and Justice Kagan was formerly the solicitor general.
