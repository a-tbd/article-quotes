Those foreigners had been barred by an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/refugee-muslim-executive-order-trump.html">executive order</a> signed by the president on Jan. 27.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="319" data-total-count="1122">After a Federal District Court in Seattle blocked Mr. Trump’s order nationwide on Friday, the Justice Department appealed the ruling late Saturday, saying that <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3452178/Stay-Motion-2-4-17.pdf" title="Document"> the president had the constitutional authority</a> to order the ban and that the court ruling “second-guesses the president’s national security judgment.”</p><figure aria-label="media" class="promo media video embedded layout-large-horizontal " data-adsensitivity="" data-autoplay="false" data-embedded="false" data-live="false" data-media-action="modal" data-videoid="100000004901825" role="group">

Some analysts had speculated that he did not want a repeat of the storm during the campaign when he accused <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/04/us/politics/donald-trump-university-judge-gonzalo-curiel.html">Judge Gonzalo P.

Mr. Trump, who had painted Mexicans as rapists and criminals, settled that case after the election.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="447" data-total-count="8214">But on Saturday morning, Mr. Trump let loose, and in the afternoon he unleashed another volley of attacks on the ruling. In <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827981079042805761">one Twitter message</a>, he questioned why a judge could “halt a Homeland Security travel ban,” which would allow “anyone, even with bad intentions,” to enter the country. An hour later, he <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827996357252243456">complained about</a> the “terrible decision,” saying it would let “many very bad and dangerous people” pour into the country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="286" data-total-count="8500">Earlier, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827865957750161408">Mr. Trump had asserted</a>, without evidence, that some Middle Eastern countries supported the immigration order. “Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban,” he wrote. “They know that if certain people are allowed in it’s death &amp; destruction!”</p><figure aria-label="media" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004913380 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" id="media-100000004913380" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/05/us/05Ban-3/05Ban-3-master675.jpg" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="230" data-total-count="8730">The Washington State case was filed on Monday, and it was assigned to Judge Robart that day. He asked for briefs on whether the state had standing to sue, with the last one due on Thursday. On Wednesday, Minnesota joined the suit.</p><div class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent " id="story-ad-4">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="253" data-total-count="8983" id="story-continues-6">On Friday evening, Judge Robart issued a temporary restraining order, requiring the government to revert to its previous immigration policies as the case moved forward. He found that the states and their citizens had been injured by Mr. Trump’s order.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="279" data-total-count="9262">“The executive order adversely affects the states’ residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations and freedom to travel,” Judge Robart wrote. He said the states had been hurt because the order affected their public universities and their tax bases.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="124" data-total-count="9386">Still, Judge Robart’s order left many questions, said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="393" data-total-count="9779">“Does the executive order violate the equal protection of the laws, amount to an establishment of religion, violate rights of free exercise, or deprive aliens of due process of law?” Professor Blackman asked. “Who knows? The analysis is bare bones, and leaves the court of appeals, as well as the Supreme Court, with no basis to determine whether the nationwide injunction was proper.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="123" data-total-count="9902">While large crowds had yet to materialize at airports, there were individual stories of people trying to enter the country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="342" data-total-count="10244">Nael Zaino, 32, a Syrian who had tried unsuccessfully for nearly a week to fly to the United States to join his wife and American-born son, was allowed to board a flight from Istanbul and then Frankfurt late Friday. He landed in Boston around 1 p.m. Saturday and emerged from immigration two hours later, said his sister-in-law Katty Alhayek.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="313" data-total-count="10557">Mr. Zaino was believed to be among the first revoked visa holders to enter the United States since the executive order went into effect. His advocates had sought a waiver for him from the State Department, citing family reunification. “Mine must be a very special case,” Mr. Zaino said by phone from Istanbul.</p><button class="button comments-button theme-speech-bubble-large" data-skip-to-para-id="">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="414" data-total-count="10971">Iranians, many of them students on their way to American universities, also rushed to book flights to transfer destinations in other Persian Gulf countries, Turkey and Europe. Pedram Paragomi, a 33-year-old Iranian medical student bound for the University of Pittsburgh, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/world/travelers-stranded-abroad.html">had been caught up</a> in the initial chaos over the travel ban, flew to Frankfurt on Saturday, where he was to transfer to a flight to Boston.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="116" data-total-count="11087">“I’m anxious,” he said from Frankfurt. “The rules keep on changing, but I think I will make it this time.”</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
