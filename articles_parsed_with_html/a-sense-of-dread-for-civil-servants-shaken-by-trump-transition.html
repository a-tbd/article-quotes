<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="238" data-total-count="2171">Federal workers are more likely to be Democrats, according to surveys. But partisanship and ideology explain only some of the intense feelings among workers, many of whom have seen Democrats and Republicans in the White House come and go.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="398" data-total-count="2569">At bars after work, in employee break rooms, on conference calls and on social media networks, employees at agencies targeted for steep reductions fear for their jobs. They worry about Mr. Trump’s freeze on hiring and regulations, his pledge to reverse environmental protections, and his executive order shutting down immigration for refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="371" data-total-count="2940">Some federal workers welcome Mr. Trump’s promises to create new jobs, build infrastructure and lower taxes. Others say they are focusing on doing their jobs and trying not to be distracted by the political noise that surrounds them. Still others say they are struggling with the question of whether they want to work for a president with whom they so strongly disagree.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="174" data-total-count="3114">“What do you do,” asked Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, if you work at a place where the leader “avowedly renounces the work of that agency?”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="167" data-total-count="3281">“All of a sudden, you are faced with a real moral dilemma,” continued Mr. Connolly, whose district just outside Washington is home to thousands of federal workers.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="413" data-total-count="3694">Federal workers watched with growing alarm last year as Mr. Trump waged a campaign filled with antigovernment bombast and then during a transition in which he recruited cabinet secretaries hostile to the agencies they lead. Now they wait in these chaotic early days of Mr. Trump’s presidency as he and his political advisers use executive orders to shred the policies and traditions the workers have championed.</p><div class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent " id="story-ad-2">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="293" data-total-count="4642">“This is a crisis moment,” Mr. Dickerson told his staff that night, according to a rough transcript of his remarks. “The coalition that brought us all together for a while is broken, because the values that we have all prioritized differently are now pointing in different directions.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="413" data-total-count="5055">Four days after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, two of Mr. Trump’s advisers — Reed Cordish and Chris Liddell — attended the Digital Service’s staff meeting. The pair, who are close to Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, told the nearly 100 staff members that their expertise was valued by the president; Mr. Kushner; Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist; and others in the West Wing.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="256" data-total-count="5311">The message was meant to provide reassurance. But several members of the team said it had the opposite effect. One employee who still works there said it was the moment she realized their combined technological prowess would be harnessed for a new purpose.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="184" data-total-count="5495">“At that moment, when folks heard the name Steve Bannon, it was like a punch in the gut. It became so real,” said the employee, who declined to be identified for fear of reprisals.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="525" data-total-count="6020">Career employees are particularly nervous at the E.P.A., which Mr. Trump repeatedly singled out for attack on the campaign trail, vowing at one point to “get rid of” the agency. On Monday, about 100 employees at the agency’s Chicago office, which oversees the enforcement of environmental regulations in five Midwestern states, used their lunch hour to protest the Senate’s confirmation of Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, to lead the agency. Mr. Pruitt was a fierce critic of its mission under Mr. Obama.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="220" data-total-count="6240">“I have been through several transitions, but I have never had or seen this level of alarm,” said Nicole Cantello, an E.P.A. lawyer in the Chicago office, who heads the Chicago-area union of the agency’s employees.</p><div class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent " id="story-ad-3">


</div>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="284" data-total-count="6524" id="story-continues-5">Ms. Cantello, who has worked for the E.P.A. prosecuting cases since 1990, said that during the George W. Bush administration, some career employees had quietly bristled at more industry-friendly environmental regulations. But at no point did they feel the alarm they do now, she said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="122" data-total-count="6646">“Unless there’s an abject abandoning of E.P.A.’s role in the world, we’ll do what we’re told to do,” she said.</p><div aria-labeledby="newsletter-promo-heading" class="newsletter-signup variant-1-hidden " data-newsletter-productcode="NN" data-newsletter-producttitle="Morning Briefing" id="newsletter-promo">
